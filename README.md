## campsite-checker

This is a python script which attempts to automate the process of reserving sites on recreation.gov.  It is especially made for sought-after campsites which have limited booking windows.

### Dependencies
* OS X or Unix variant
* Python
* Selenium (current release)
* geckodriver (current release)
* Firefox (current release)

* If you're unfamiliar with the above tools, and using OS X: You already have a version of Python preinstalled.
* You can install Selenium by opening a Terminal window and entering the following command: `sudo easy_install selenium` or `pip install selenium`
* On OS X you can install the geckodriver using [homebrew](http://brew.sh), like so: `brew install geckodriver`

### Running the script

Copy `checker_example.ini` to `checker.ini` and edit all the fields as required.
You must have a `[reservation_#]` section for each reservation that you are
trying to make. See below for how to find site\_id and park\_id values from the
recreation.gov website.

Once you've edited the configuration file, open up a Terminal window in the
directory containing this script and enter the command `python ./checker.py` to
run the script.

Recommended use pattern is to begin the script shortly before reservations are
due to open, with a low number of retries. Recreation.gov network usage is
monitored and you risk account termination if you just leave this running all
day.

If a site is found that matches your requirements, you will have 15 minutes to
complete the purchase in the browser window.

*Note*: If you find, after playing with this script, that you have lots of
Firefox windows open, you can kill them all on a Unix based platform with a
command like `$ killall firefox-bin`.

### Finding park\_id and site\_id

Find the campsite you wish to book on recreation.gov - do not enter selected
dates. Go to the 'Site List' page, and hover over the 'Enter Date' button by the
site you are interested in.  In the lower left of your browser, you will see a
URL like the following:

`http://www.recreation.gov/camping/Wawona/r/campsiteDetails.do?contractCode=NRSO&siteId=204305&parkId=70924`

The site ID and park ID are the numbers specified at the end of the URL.
